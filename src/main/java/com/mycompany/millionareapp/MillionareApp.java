 * ChatGPT helped with this class
 * 
 * this class is the main method of the project. it uses the data from the 
 * questions.txt file through the file question repository class so cant 
 * directly interfere with the file. it also builds the game through the game 
 * engine and game persistence classes and passes everything to the game 
 * controller class to ensure the game runs smoothly
 */

/**
 * APPLICATION ENTRY (GUI-first).
 * What to change:
 *  - Launch GUI on the EDT (SwingUtilities.invokeLater).
 *  - Construct GameRepository("db/MillionaireDB"), call ensureSchema() and (optionally) seedIfEmpty(...).
 *  - Create GameEngine and feed repo.findAllQuestions().
 *  - Create GameUI + GUIController and call controller.start(); set frame visible.
 *  - (Optional) Keep CLI flag to start legacy console path for testing.
